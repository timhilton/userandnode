# User & Node Version theme
This `oh-my-zsh` theme displays your username, node version, path, and git info in a clean zsh theme.

## Custom ZSH themes

This repo is for custom ZSH themes that I will make available as I decide to change them. As a developer, needs change, and your terminal prompt should provide you with the info you need. I'll add more themes as I make them. Currently `userandnode` is the only theme available. Feel free to clone this repo and add it to your themes.  

#### **Installation**
You will have to install this manually by copying or moving `userandnode.zsh-theme` to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` and then in your `.zshrc` file setting `ZSH_THEME="userandnode"`.

#### **Dependencies**
This theme assumes that you have `oh-my-zsh` and `nvm` installed.
